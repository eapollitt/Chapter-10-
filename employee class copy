#one employee and five instances from the payroll deduction class
#comparing to see if the employee ids match jimmy smith and deduct that from his total pay monthly salary and if id doesnt then dont deduct it
#use a for loop to go through th ids 
#hard code the values in the instance side 
#class all accessor methods (get methods )
#calculations can be done in the program side
